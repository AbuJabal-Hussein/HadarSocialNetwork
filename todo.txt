As a user in need,
Iâ€™d like to view my previous and current help requests in a feed,
So, I can observe their status.

1- clicking on the post will display window showing the request status:
         1 - fulfilled or not
          2 - renew button
          3 - if not fulfilled , show a list of offers (if there is any) 
              button
